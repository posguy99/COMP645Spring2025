    <h1>Marc Wilson</h1>

    <h2>Past</h2>
    <p>The past has already happened. It is supposed to be immutable. I took a class last semester, I can't go back and
        un-take that class.
        Cannot make that un-happen, after all.
    </p>

    <h2>Present</h2>
    <p>The present is now. You can change the present by making different choices.
    </p>

    <h2>Future</h2>
    <p>The future hasn't happened yet. In four weeks we will be taking a different class, and four weeks after that
        another different class.
    </p>
