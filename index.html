    <h1>Marc Wilson</h1>

    <h2>Past</h2>
    <p>What's to say about the past.  Grow up, go to school, work.  Been doing those things for years.
        Life is life.
    </p>

    <h2>Present</h2>
    <p>Present?  Now it's taking this class.  Doing this assignment, making the video.
        It's a shame that people cheat like that.
    </p>

    <h2>Future</h2>
    <p>The future hasn't happened yet. In four weeks we will be taking a different class, and four weeks after that
        another different class.  Then a certificate.  Then apply what we've learned in work.
    </p>
